# Free, Open-Source Cookie Consent Banner with Google Consent Mode v2 Integration
This project provides a free and open-source cookie consent banner that integrates with Google Consent Mode v2 (GCM v2).

## What is GCM v2?

Google Consent Mode v2 is a framework that helps websites comply with user privacy regulations by enabling granular control over cookie consent. It allows users to choose which types of cookies they want to accept, and transmits those preferences to Google services like Analytics and Ads.

## What does the code do?

The code displays a cookie consent banner with options to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or configure preferences for specific cookie categories. Users can then save their preferences, and the script sends those preferences to Google Tag Manager (GTM) using GCM v2.

## How to Install:

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/CiroArtigot/cookieconsentbanner-gcm2

Instructions for configuring GTM to work with the cookie consent banner will be added soon.
